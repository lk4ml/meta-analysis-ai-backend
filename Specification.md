---

## üß≠ Overview

This application is designed to streamline the meta-analysis process for researchers by automating question intake, PubMed retrieval, AI-based paper screening, data extraction, and final report generation.

---

## üìê Functional Scope

The application will support the following key backend functionalities:

1. Capture user-defined research question and PICO criteria  
2. Rephrase the question using AI for better specificity  
3. Retrieve relevant papers from PubMed using MeSH term expansion  
4. Screen papers using AI-generated criteria  
5. Score papers based on relevance  
6. Extract structured data from top papers  
7. Generate and export a final evidence report

    "score": 4.5,
    "title": "...",
    "abstract": "...",
    "pdf_link": "..."
  }
]
```

---

### 5. `POST /extract-data`
**Purpose**: Extract structured meta-analysis data from selected papers.

**Payload**
```json
{
  "paper_ids": ["12345678", "23456789"]
}
```

**Response**
```json
[
  {
    "pmid": "12345678",

## ü§ñ AI & Processing Services

| Component                | Description |
|--------------------------|-------------|
| **Rephrasing Service**   | Uses LLM to rephrase user question with specificity using PICO, if user has provided , if user has not provided any PICO critiera Just generate few options suggesting patient specicifcty, outcomes specificity|
| **PubMed Retrieval Service** | Use pubemd api to transform final question into mesh terms and generate, queries PubMed, and retrieves papers with Paper id, title,abstract, authoers, dates, pubmed id |
| **Paper Screening Engine** | AI-based generation of six columns: Study Design, Intervention, Population, Outcomes, Treatment Characteristics, etc. |
|**AI Generated Column**| A service that allows user to generate AI based columns based upon user needs 
| **Scoring Engine**       | Computes total score based on Yes (1), Maybe (0.5), No (0) |
| **Data Extraction Engine** | Extracts structured meta-data from paper body/PDF or abstract based upon overall scoring threshold decided by user |
| **Report Builder**       | Aggregates final selected paper data into a CSV/XLSX file |

## ‚úÖ Backend Design Considerations

- Use modular services: LLM, PubMed, Scoring, Extraction
- Cache PubMed results with expiry
- Add retry and error handling for external API calls
- Store intermediate results for traceability
- Secure API with auth keys if user accounts are supported
- Use background jobs for PDF processing and report generation
- Well designed use cases that tests out all the services and apis
- Fully fucntional backend that can be used as a demo for tehcincal audience, like input question and generating next steps afterwords.

## üìå Future Features (Planned)

- PDF upload by users for non-PubMed papers  
- User authentication and history  
- Fine-tuned model for domain-specific screening  
- Visual analytics in reports (forest plots, charts)  
- Integration with Zotero, EndNote
